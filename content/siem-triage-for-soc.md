# 📧 SIEM Triage for SOC

Hands-on SIEM investigation using Splunk to analyze Linux and Windows security logs, detect brute force attacks, privilege escalation, and persistence techniques through real-world SOC scenarios.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Learn how to properly investigate alerts in a SOC environment.
- Understand how to investigate brute-force attacks on Linux systems.
- Discover the persistence mechanism on Windows systems.
- Analyse a web shell on a vulnerable web server.
- Learn how to investigate alerts for three given scenarios using Splunk.

## 📷 Evidence & Analysis

### 1️. Failed Login Attempts on john.smith

**Explanation:**  
Logs showed repeated Failed password events for john.smith, indicating brute force attack.

**Impact:**
- Increased risk of credential compromise
- Possible account takeover attempts
- Higher chance of unauthorized system access
- Early indicator of brute-force activity

---

### 2. Duration of the Brute Force Attack

**Explanation:**  
By comparing the earliest and latest failed login timestamps, the total attack window was calculated

**Impact:**
- Indicates weak brute-force protection mechanisms
- Increased exposure to automated attacks
- Higher probability of successful password guessing
- Lack of effective rate limiting or intrusion prevention

---

### 3. Privilege Escalation Target Account

**Explanation:**  
The attacker used sudo to execute su, gaining full administrative privileges.

**Impact:**
- Full administrative control gained by the attacker
- Ability to modify system configurations
- Potential deployment of malware or backdoors
- Compromise of system integrity and confidentiality

---

### 4. Persistence Account Created

**Explanation:**  
Logs from useradd / adduser revealed the creation of a new account after privilege escalation.

**Impact:**
- Enables long-term unauthorized access
- Bypasses credential reset efforts
- Increases difficulty of incident remediation
- Supports future lateral movement and reinfection

---

### 5. Process Responsible for Task Creation

**Explanation:**  
The Process ID represents the exact running instance that executed the command responsible for registering the scheduled task. By correlating this identifier with system activity, the investigation was able to isolate the process directly involved in establishing persistence.

**Impact:**
- Trace the origin of the attack
- Reconstruct the execution chain
- Support incident containment and forensic analysis

---

### 6. Parent Process Behind Task Creation

**Explanation:**  
The parent process represents the initial execution vector that spawned the process used to create the scheduled task.

**Impact:**
- Defense evasion
- Persistence establishment
- Long-term system compromise
